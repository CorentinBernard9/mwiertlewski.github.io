We are always looking for talented students to join our research group. Feel free to get in touch to see if there is unannounced opportunities.

#### Open PhD and Postdoc positions

We do not have any open position at the moment. However, we are open to support applications for personal grants such as the Marie Curie Fellowship.

#### Info for prospective MSc students

A list of interesting assignments is safely kept in a vault in Michaël's office. If you are interested to pursue your Master thesis with us, and learn more about the haptic device, sense of touch or contact mechanics of soft robots, drop an email to [Michaël](mailto:m.wiertlewski@tudelft.nl) to arrange for a discussion.
